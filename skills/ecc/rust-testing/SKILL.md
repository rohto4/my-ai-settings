# Rust Testing Patterns

Comprehensive Rust testing patterns for writing reliable, maintainable tests following TDD methodology.

## When to Use

- Writing new Rust functions, methods, or traits
- Adding test coverage to existing code
- Creating benchmarks for performance-critical code
- Implementing property-based tests for input validation
- Following TDD workflow in Rust projects

## How It Works

1. **Identify target code** — Find the function, trait, or module to test
2. **Write a test** — Use `#[test]` in a `#[cfg(test)]` module, rstest for parameterized tests, or proptest for property-based tests
3. **Mock dependencies** — Use mockall to isolate the unit under test
4. **Run tests (RED)** — Verify the test fails with the expected error
5. **Implement (GREEN)** — Write minimal code to pass
6. **Refactor** — Improve while keeping tests green
7. **Check coverage** — Use cargo-llvm-cov, target 80%+

## Use Detailed Guidance

1. Read the repository instructions and identify the exact Rust and Cargo version, target files, and validation command.
2. Open [detailed-patterns.md](references/detailed-patterns.md) and read only the sections relevant to the requested change.
3. Apply the smallest compatible pattern, then run the narrow project checks before broader verification.
4. Report files changed, commands and observed results, skipped checks, and remaining risk.
