# Ktor Server Patterns

Comprehensive Ktor patterns for building robust, maintainable HTTP servers with Kotlin coroutines.

## When to Activate

- Building Ktor HTTP servers
- Configuring Ktor plugins (Auth, CORS, ContentNegotiation, StatusPages)
- Implementing REST APIs with Ktor
- Setting up dependency injection with Koin
- Writing Ktor integration tests with testApplication
- Working with WebSockets in Ktor

## Use Detailed Guidance

1. Read the repository instructions and identify the exact Kotlin version, framework version, target files, and validation command.
2. Open [detailed-patterns.md](references/detailed-patterns.md) and read only the sections relevant to the requested change.
3. Apply the smallest compatible pattern, then run the narrow project checks before broader verification.
4. Report files changed, commands and observed results, skipped checks, and remaining risk.

## Operating Boundaries

- Keep diagnosis read-only and exercise routes with local fixtures or fake services first. Treat real tokens, live APIs, deploys, sends, pushes, or remote writes as separate actions requiring explicit approval immediately before execution.
